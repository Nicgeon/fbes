Project for my ITA degree

# 
Fbes is supposed to be a website that allows you to register for a Bus station, so the driver is aware of the passengers wanting to drive onboard the bus.

## The Problem
The problem is that the drivers are not aware of the passengers wanting to drive onboard the bus. Especially in smaller more remote areas busses sometimes skip stops.
This system is supposted to be an idea to sovle the isssue, by makign the Bus driver aware of the passengers wanting to drive onboard the bus.

### Sidenote
Because i am a rookie when it comes to building websites, this is probaply a horrible project based out of an experts pserpective.

The project ist also not thought through, so i am unaware how realistic the actual usage of this Project would be.

At the moment its probaply a saftey nightmare, but for the demonstration it is eougth.
